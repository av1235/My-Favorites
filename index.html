      <h3>
          I have many hobbies such as reading books, swimming, playing tennis, or even drawing, but my favorite hobby is playing chess. I have been playing chess since I was six years old. I like playing chess because it is a game that requires strategy, tactics and analytical skills. I also play in chess tournaments, and currently have a rating of 1200. Chess is something that anyone could learn, and it is a really fun sport!!!
